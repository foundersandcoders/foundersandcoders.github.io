  <h2>The programme</h2>

  <p>
    Founders &amp; Coders is a freelance co-operative. For those who are interested, the introductory course can lead to an apprenticeship and membership of the co-operative. As an apprentice, you will be expected to contribute to our educational programme and to collaborate closely with other members. After that, the world is your oyster.
  </p>

    We are now taking applications for the course starting on September 14th. This is an 8-week, full-time course at our campus in London's East End, optionally followed by several weeks of <a href="/mvp">project work</a>. 
  </p>

    Although tuition is free, we cannot assist you with living expenses nor can we guarantee work for you after you complete the course.

  <h2>Course prerequisites</h2>

  <p>If you have accepted a place on the next course, you will be expected to complete all the material below beforehand. If you have any doubts about your ability to complete any of it, please contact us before the start of the course.</p>

  <h3>Codecademy</h3>

  <p>If you are not at all familiar with web programming, Codecademy is a good place to start. We recommend the following tracks.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website/"><em>Make a website</em></a></li> 
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-an-interactive-website/"><em>Make an interactive website</em></a></li> 
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web"><em>HTML &amp; CSS</em></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery"><em>jQuery</em></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript"><em>JavaScript</em></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/projects"><em>Web Projects</em></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube"><em>YouTube API</em></a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Communities</h3>

  <p>Once you are somewhat familiar with Javascript, you should join Codewars, Stackoverflow and GitHub. We will also invite you to join the FACapplicants community on GitHub.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript">Sign up for Code Wars</a></strong> and aim to reach Novice level with their JavaScript challenges.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Sign up with Stack Overflow</a></strong> and start asking questions.</p>   

  <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/">Sign up with GitHub</a></strong> and explore the public repositories.</p> 

  <h3>Courses</h3>

  <p><strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/insidetheinternet/"><em>Internet History, Technology, and Security</em></a></strong>. A well-rated and largely non-technical course from the the University of Michigan on Coursera.</p>

  <p><strong>Stanford's <a href="https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/CS101/Summer2014/about"><em>Computer Science 101</em></a></strong>. CS101 is a gentle introduction to programming concepts that uses (a slightly doctored version of) JavaScript, so it is perfect for our purposes. Expect to spend about 10-15 hours on it, including watching the lectures and completing the exercises.</p>

  <h3>Exercises</h3>

  <p><a href="http://flukeout.github.io/#"><strong>CSS Diner</strong></a>. A great way to learn CSS selectors. Hint: the answers to the first three levels are: <em>plate</em>, <em>bento</em> and <em>#fancy</em>. Hopefully, you will be able to take it from there.</p>

  <h3>Typing</h3>

  <p>Learn to touch type. And make sure that you know not just the main letter keys, but all the outer keys, too. There are many good teaching apps, but <a href="http://www.typingclub.com/">Typing Club</a> is good (and free).</p>

  <h3>Reading</h3>

  <p>We like <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/"><strong>Eloquent JavaScript</strong></a>. It is available free online and includes a number of embedded code snippets that you can edit and run as you read.</h3>

  <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX"><strong>Steve Yegge's Google platforms rant</strong></a>. <em>"Amazon does everything wrong, and Google does everything right...But there's one thing they do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups"</em>.</p>

  <h3>Watching</h3>

  <p><a href="http://youtu.be/5Tk09c0FQ3M"><strong>Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future</strong></a>, a talk by Ed Lazowska.</p>

  <p><a href="http://youtu.be/gTAghAJcO1o"><strong>The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental</strong></a>, a talk by Alan Kay.</p>

  <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366"><strong>Inventing on Principle</strong></a>, a talk by Bret Victor.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB"><strong>Crockford on JavaScript</strong></a>. A wonderful series of lectures by Doug Crockford. A panaramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. Watch each lecture until you are no longer enjoying the experience and then fast forward or move onto the next one (Lecture 3 is probably the hardest to follow). You may want to rewatch these lectures at the end of the course.</p>
