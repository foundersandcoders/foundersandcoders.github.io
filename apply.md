## The programme

Founders & Coders runs what is probably the most challenging course of its kind in the UK: An eight-week, full-time foundation course in software development for the Web, followed by a further eight weeks [building a portfolio](/mvp) and then the possibility of an apprenticeship as a member of the Founders & Coders freelance co-operative.

## The next course

We are now taking applications for the course starting on September 14th, based at our campus in London's East End.

Although tuition is free, we cannot assist you with living expenses nor can we guarantee work for you after you complete the course.

## The application process

+ [Application form, Part 1](/apply1.html) (the shorter one) 
+ [Application form, Part 2](/apply2.html) (the longer one) 

In some cases, we may also request a short in-person paired programming session (remote sessions can also be arranged). 

Please be aware that we receive many applications for each place and selection is highly competitive.

## Application deadlines

+ First application deadline: May 18th.
+ Second application deadline: June 15th.
+ Third application deadline: July 13th.
+ Final application deadline: August 10th.

We aim to accept around four applicants after each deadline. We do it this way, so that applicants can get feedback on their application within a month or so of applying. Early applicants will either get a confirmed place or their application will remain in the applicant pool until the final deadline.

## Things you can do to improve your chances of getting on the course

+ Apply early 
+ Record your voice at an adequate sound level on your video and keep it to under two minutes
+ Aim to reach at least 6 kyu on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript)
+ Contribute to the [Coding for everyone](https://github.com/codingforeveryone)  community on GitHub    
(we will send you an invitation to join when you complete Part 1 of the application) 

You can contribute to the community by communicating with other members of the community: posting questions, answering questions, posting your Codewars kata, or any other way that you like.

If you have no coding experience, getting to 6 kyu (or higher) in Code wars will take time. If you are an absolute beginner, you will need to spend a considerable amount of time to meet the required standard. 

But please do not be daunted. We encourage you to seek help and encouragement from other applicants. Join us on GitHub, use our Gitter channel, and if you live in London consider signing up for our [Monday evening meetups](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/).

## Course prerequisites

Before you join us, you will be expected to complete all the material below. If you have any doubts about your ability to complete any of it, please contact us before the start of the course.

### Codecademy

If you are not at all familiar with web programming, Codecademy is a good place to start. We recommend the following tracks.

+ [*Make a website*](http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website/) 
+ [*Make an interactive website*](http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-an-interactive-website/) 
+ [*HTML & CSS*](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)
+ [*jQuery*](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery)
+ [*JavaScript*](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript)
+ [*Web Projects*](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/projects)
+ [*YouTube API*](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube)

### Communities

Once you are somewhat familiar with Javascript, you should join Codewars, Stackoverflow and GitHub. We will also invite you to join the *Coding for everyone* community on GitHub.

**[Sign up for Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript)** and aim to reach at least Novice level with their JavaScript challenges.

**[Sign up for Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)** and start asking questions.   

**[Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/)** and contribute to [Coding for everyone](https://github.com/codingforeveryone). 

### Exercises

[**CSS Diner**](http://flukeout.github.io/#). A great way to learn CSS selectors. Hint: the answers to the first three levels are: *plate*, *bento* and *#fancy*. Hopefully, you will be able to take it from there.

### Typing

Learn to touch type. And make sure that you know not just the main letter keys, but all the outer keys, too. There are many good teaching apps, but [Typing Club](http://www.typingclub.com/) is good (and free).

### Reading

We like [**Eloquent JavaScript**](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). It is available free online and includes a number of embedded code snippets that you can edit and run as you read.

[**Steve Yegge's Google platforms rant**](https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX). *"Amazon does everything wrong, and Google does everything right...But there's one thing they do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups"*.

### Watching

[**Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future**](http://youtu.be/5Tk09c0FQ3M), a talk by Ed Lazowska.

[**The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental**](http://youtu.be/gTAghAJcO1o), a talk by Alan Kay.

[**Inventing on Principle**](http://vimeo.com/36579366), a talk by Bret Victor.

[**Crockford on JavaScript**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB). A wonderful series of lectures by Doug Crockford. A panaramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. Watch each lecture until you are no longer enjoying the experience and then fast forward or move onto the next one (Lecture 3 is probably the hardest to follow). You may want to rewatch these lectures at the end of the course.
