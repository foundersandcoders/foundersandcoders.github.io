<h1 class="big">An MVP for £500</h1> 

<div class="pullquote">
  "Founders &amp; Coders have been a game-changing resource for our business. They had the knowledge and work ethic to deliver our product from concept stage. With each project they have exceeded our expectations in terms of cost, product quality and timescale. It’s a pleasure to work with such an enthusiastic development team."

**Manage your own product development team. Receive practical training in product management.  Get an MVP.**

*What is an MVP?*     
It stands for minimal viable product. An MVP has the minimum set of features that allow a product to be launched.

*What sort of MVPs do you build?*     
We build MVPs for web applications. In other words, a software application that runs in a web browser.

*Is this service just for startups?*     
No, it is for any person or company that wants to try out an idea that may be of use to their friends, colleagues, clients or service users.

*What can I realistically expect?*     
A well-thought-out product idea with a simple minimum feature set has a much better chance of being delivered than something more vague or complex. If we do not think we can deliver an MVP successfully we will not take a project on.

*What’s the first step?*     
After you have submitted your idea, we will book you in for a date to pitch to us. Pitches usually take place Tuesdays to Thursdays at 5.30pm.

*How does a pitch work?*     
We will invite you to come onto our campus to pitch your idea and take questions from our developers. It is important we understand your idea, what you want to achieve for your MVP, and when and if you are likely to want any follow up work. If you wish, you can bring a visual presentation, too.

*What happens next?*     
If our developers agree that we have a realistic chance of delivering a useful MVP for you, then we will contact you and request permission to raise an invoice for £500.

*How long do I have to wait for work to start*     
As soon as you have paid, we will allocate you the first available start date that is convenient for you.

*Why do I have to pay before work starts?*    
Demand for our MVP programme outstrips supply and we need to know that clients are committed to the process before we can schedule a date for work to start.

*What is my involvement in the process?*     
On the first day of the build, you will be invited to join your development team to agree a product specification. You will also be invited to a presentation at the end of the project, when the MVP will be delivered.

*What benefits will I get from the process?*     
You will get your own full-time dedicated development team for the length of the project and you will be invited to join the team as the product owner. You will receive any necessary training in agile project management, including elements of project specification, wireframing, user stories, and testing. You will receive a fully-documented MVP at the end of the process.

*Do you also build iPhone and Android apps?*     
Generally, not for an MVP. In most cases, it is better to build a prototype as a web app first, but we can do follow-up work to convert a web app into a phone app.

*What happens if I am not happy with the work done?*     
If the MVP does not meet the agreed specification, then you can request a full refund and your development team will not be paid.

*What happens if I want further work done on my MVP?*    
If you are happy with the MVP, you can retain some or all of your development team to continue to work on it for you. Our freelance rates start at £80/day.

*How do I find out more?*
