#MVP FAQ

***What is an MVP?***    
It stands for *minimal viable product*. An *MVP* has the minimum set of features that allow a product to be launched.

***What sort of MVPs do you build?***    
We build *MVPs* for web applications. In other words, a software application that runs in a web browser.

***Is this service just for startups?***    
No, it is for any person or company that wants to try out an idea that may be of use to their friends, colleagues, clients or service users.

***What can I realistically expect?***    
A well-thought-out product idea with a simple minimum feature set has a much better chance of being delivered than something more vague or complex. If we do not think we can deliver an *MVP* successfully we will not take a project on.

***What's the first step?***    
After you have [submitted your idea](/mvp), we will book you in for a date to pitch to us. Pitches usually take place Mondays to Thursdays at 5.30pm. 

***How does a pitch work?***    
We will invite you to come onto our campus to pitch your idea and take questions from our developers. It is important we understand your idea, what you want to achieve for your MVP, and when and if you are likely to want any follow up work. If you wish, you can bring a visual presentation, too.

**What happens next?**    
If both you and our developers agree that we have a realistic chance of delivering a useful *MVP* for you within a week, then your product will be added to our *MVP* backlog and a date and team selected to deliver it.

***What is my involvement in the process?***    
On the first day of the build week, you will be invited to join your development team to agree a product specification. If you cannot join the team in person, we can arrange a Skype call. You will also be invited to a first sprint review mid-week and a final sprint review at the end of the week, when the *MVP* will be delivered.

***What benefits will I get from the process?***    
Not only will you get an *MVP*, but you will be involved in an agile development process. If you have not worked with a software development team before or used agile methods, this can be a very useful experience.

***Do you also build iPhone and Android apps?***    
Generally, not for an *MVP*. In most cases, it is better to build a prototype as a web app first, but we can do follow-up work to convert a web app into a phone app.

***What happens if I am not happy with the work done?***    
If the *MVP* is not up to the standard you expected or does not meet the agreed specification after one week and you do not wish to use it, then you do not have to pay for the development work.

***What happens if I want further work done on my MVP?***    
If you are happy with the *MVP*, you can retain some or all of your development team to continue to work on it for you.

***What about confidentiality?***    
We take your commercial confidentiality very seriously. If you request it, all personnel present at your pitch will sign a non-disclosure agreement. 

***How do I find out more?***    
If you are not sure that this is for you, please [contact us](#contact).
