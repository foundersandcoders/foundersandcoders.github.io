#MVP FAQ

***What is an MVP?***    
It stands for *minimal viable product*. An MVP has the minimum set of features that allow a product to be launched.

***What sort of MVPs do you build?***    
We build MVPs for web applications. In other words, a software application that runs in a web browser.

***Is this service just for startups?***    
No, it is for any person or company that wants to try out an idea that may be of use to their friends, colleagues, clients or service users.

***What's the first step?***    
After you have [submitted your idea](/mvp), we will book you in for a date to pitch it to us.

***How does a pitch work?***    
We will invite you to come onto our campus to pitch your product idea and take questions from our developers. If both you and our students agree that we have a realistic chance of delivering a useful MVP for you within a week, then your product will be added to our MVP backlog and a date and team selected to deliver it.

***What is my involvement in the process?***    
On the first day of the build week, you will be invited to join your development team to agree a product specification. If you cannot join the team in person, we can arrange a Skype call. You will also be invited to a first sprint review on Wednesday evening and a final sprint review on Friday evening, when the MVP will be delivered.

***What benefits will I get from the process?***    
Not only will you get an *MVP*, but you will be involved in an agile development process. If you have not worked with a software development team before or used agile methods, this can be a very useful experience.

***Do you also build iPhone and Android apps?***    
Generally, not for an MVP. In most cases, it is better to build a prototype as a web app first, but we can do follow-up work to convert a web app into a phone app.

***What happens if I am not happy with the work done?***    
If the MVP is not up to the standard you expected or does not meet the agreed specification after one week and you do not wish to use it, then you do not have to pay for the development work.

***What happens if I want further work done on my MVP?***    
If you are happy with the MVP, you can retain some or all of your development team to continue to work on it. Rates for graduate developers are Â£10/hour.

***How do I find out more?***    
If you are not sure that this is for you, we run a [tech clinic on Tuesday evenings](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/) when you can come in and discuss your product idea with us.
